Add table output with some power values

Add ability to create guides for multiple values of power and df.
	-This is difficult.
	-For df guides, The issue is finding the x intercepts for each power value.
	-For power guides, the issue is creating the correct mapping() in ggplot.
		-Try just making a mapping of min(df) to max(df), with y=yIntercept, group=yIntercept
Colorize the guide lines by power/df specified.
